# kandi-tutkielma

This repo contains the written part of my B.Sc. thesis (in Finnish).
Topic of the thesis was "Simulated annealing and detecting circles in images".

Link to code (TBA).

## Why there's so few commits...?

(In the old working repo I maintained both the code and the tex files, in different branches, and that turned out quite messy.
So I copied the tex parts into this *brand new cool repo* for publishing it here on GitHub.)

## I found an error in the text!

Shame on me. Please report firstname.surname@helsinki.fi or use the issue mechanism if you feel adventurous :-)
